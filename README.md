# Vim Textobj Wiw

A vim plugin that adds 'inner words', i.e. parts of hyphenated, underscored, or camel-cased words, as text objects. A fork of [this repository](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-textobj-wiw), with different keybindings. I changed them from `im` and `am` to `ih` and `ah`â€”'h' is on the home row, and you can think 'hyphen' to remember it.
